{% image "uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-10.34.11-AM.png", "Curious to see where your views fall along the political spectrum?" %}

My results?

**You are 93% conservative and 7% liberal, you are Very Right Wing!**

Your political views skew very right wing, so it should come as no surprise that you've probably voted Republican in the last couple elections. You believe in shrinking the size of government, eliminating entitlement programs, and maintaining a robust military. In regards to social issues, you may not agree with where the country is heading, but you voice your opposition nonetheless, exercising your constitutional-right to freedom-of-speech whenever necessary.

Now, [how about you?](http://brainfall.com/quizzes/how-conservative-liberal-are-you/0v9m853/?utm_source=16-03-21-16&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=3-18-16-conservativeliberal-ntfan-w&utm_term=17&utm_content=Very%20Right%20Wing)
