Provocative title? You bet.

Despite calls to remove the controversial article *Why I Hate August* by K. Edward Copeland, the article still remains live on TGC's website at [https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/why-i-hate-august/](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/why-i-hate-august/). In the article Dr. Copeland that compared the actions of 17-year Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, to the Charleston Church shooter Dylan Roof.
