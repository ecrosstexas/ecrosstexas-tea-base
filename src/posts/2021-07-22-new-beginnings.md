Enough goofing around I'm starting over with [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev/).  I've barely been blogging for years now.  I took my [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) site down almost 2 years ago after the site be compromised thanks to an insecure plugin I was running. I've had every intention of getting my site back up running again with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) for years, but alas nothing.

I discovered Eleventy a little more than a year ago now. It is still not a 1.0 project, but it inches closer all the time.  It's more than good enough for production use today. I just can't seem to move forward without everything in place and everything complete. I want to believe in creating in public and iterative design, yet I sit on my hands and don't launch anything.

Well that changes today. ecrosstexas.com is going back online as a functional website and I am going to commit to a [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) to get this site where I want it to be again. All my old content and blog posts will finally be coming back online.

Thank you to Shane Robinson for this [TEAstack](https://github.com/shanerobinson/tea-base-template) _(TailwindCSS, 11ty, Alpine.js)_ small site/blog template.

Come along with me and enjoy the ride. Buckle up, it might be bumpy!
